# World_Health_Sensor_Project

Using The Global Health Observatory OData API to fetch data from it's data collection. Analyze the data using data science techniques and create an interactive dashboard to visualize and explore the insights.

## Project general description

The GHO data repository serves as the World Health Organization's (WHO) portal to health-related statistics concerning its 194 Member States. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) is constructed using a technology called RESTful web service. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style used to design networked applications. In this context, GHO uses RESTful web services as the underlying technology to provide access to its data.

Initially, I named the project the "World Health Sensor Project" because I aimed to work with reliable and comprehensive global health data. As I progressed, I narrowed my focus to tobacco-related data. However, the project has the potential for expansion to include analysis and communication of various other health topics and indicators found in the GHO repository.


## Project steps

1. **Select the Data Source:** Determined the specific OData API that provided the data needed for the analysis. Explored available public datasets and repositories. Determined the analysis goals in the past.

2. **Understand the API:** Studied the documentation of the OData API in the past to understand its endpoints, query parameters, and how to retrieve data. Identified the available resources, data models, and relationships between entities in the past.

3. **Retrieve and Preprocess Data:** Used the OData API to fetch the required data based on the analysis goals in the past. Applied data preprocessing steps like cleaning, filtering, and transforming the data as necessary to prepare it for analysis in the past.

3. **Analyze the Data:** Utilized data science techniques and libraries such as pandas, stats to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and statistical analysis in the past. Extracted meaningful insights and identified patterns or correlations in the data in the past. Selected the appropriate visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create interactive and informative visualizations in the past.

4. **Design the Dashboard:** Designed the user interface and layout of the dashboard using libraries Dash in the past. Created an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard that allowed users to interact with the visualizations, apply filters, and explore the data dynamically in the past. **Tested and Iterated:** Tested the functionality and usability of the dashboard in the past.

5. **Deploy the Dashboard:** Hosted the dashboard on a web server or a cloud platform to make it accessible online in the past. This involved deploying it as a web application or utilizing cloud hosting services like Heroku or AWS in the past. 

## Application description

As I explained, after connecting with GHO API, the exploration derived in the building of the dashboard: ** "Global Tobacco Insights: Visualizing Smoking Trends, Health Consequences, and Control Policies" ** a dashboard that display important information about Smoking Prevalence by sex, countries and WHO regions, the relationship between smoking rates and premature deaths caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and the efforts being undertaken by the countries to accomplish the MPOWER strategy.
