# Project general description

The GHO data repository serves as the World Health Organization's (WHO) portal to health-related statistics concerning its 194 Member States. 

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) is constructed using a technology called RESTful web service. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style used to design networked applications. In this context, GHO uses RESTful web services as the underlying technology to provide access to its data.

The initial personal motivation to build this project came from the curiosity about the trend in Tobacco consumption and global tobacco control initiatives, then the exploration of the data focus on Tobacco data related.

Tobacco use is indeed a significant contributor to a wide range of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and is a leading cause of preventable illness and death worldwide. The exploration derived in the building of the dashboard: ** "Global Tobacco Insights: Visualizing Smoking Trends, Control Policies and Premature Deaths" ** a dashboard that display important information about Smoking Prevalence by sex, countries and WHO regions, the efforts being undertaken by the countries to accomplish the MPOWER strategy and the significant relationship between smoking rates and premature deaths caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
