# World_Health_Sensor_Project

Using The Global Health Observatory OData API to fetch data from it's data collection. Analyze the data using data science techniques and create an interactive dashboard to visualize and explore the insights.

- Find the project workflow and the summarized version in the World Health Sensor Project and WHSP_summarized Notebooks.
- Find the application script to display the dashboard, the description of the dashboard and final datasets in Application folder.
- Explore the some plots buily during exploration and preprocessing stages in the Visualizations folder.

## Project general description

The GHO data repository serves as the World Health Organization's (WHO) portal to health-related statistics concerning its 194 Member States. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) is constructed using a technology called RESTful web service. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is an architectural style used to design networked applications. In this context, GHO uses RESTful web services as the underlying technology to provide access to its data.

Initially, I named the project the "World Health Sensor Project" because I aimed to work with reliable and comprehensive global health data. As I progressed, I narrowed my focus to tobacco-related data. However, the project has the potential for expansion to include analysis and communication of various other health topics and indicators found in the GHO repository.

As I explained, after connecting with GHO API, the exploration derived in the building of the dashboard: ** "Global Tobacco Insights: Visualizing Smoking Trends, Health Consequences, and Control Policies" ** a dashboard that display important information about Smoking Prevalence by sex, countries and WHO regions, the relationship between smoking rates and premature deaths caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and the efforts being undertaken by the countries to accomplish the MPOWER strategy.
